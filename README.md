I looked at the commercially available dew shields for my 8" LX200 and
I thought that I could do better. The requirements for my dew shield
are as follows:

* I want my dew shield to be perfectly fitted on my LX200 that takes
  into account the optical rails that are mounted on both the top and
  bottom of my LX200.
* I want a temperature controller for the dew shield that
measures both the dew point as well as the ambient temperature. The
controller will use these temperature measurements to set the
internal temperature of the dew shield to a differential temperature
that is set by the user.


## Support

All the software have been successfully compiled on Mac OS X 10.10.5
(Yosemite) and 10.11.2 (El Capitan) running Arduino IDE 1.6.5. Note:
Later versions of Arduino IDE cannot compile the Arduino Pro Micro
library. See the README.md in the arduino directory for more
information.

This is unsupported software and hardware. Build at your own peril! :)

You can submit questions or bug reports using the
[issues](https://github.com/cytan299/ultimate_dew_shield/issues) tab on
the right and then click on **NEW**.

Have fun!
