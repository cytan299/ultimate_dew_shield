# Arduino libraries that are required for the controller

This directory contains all the libraries that are necessary for
building *controller.ino*. All these libraries have to be installed in

*~/Documents/Arduino/libraries*

on a Mac. For Linux or a PC, you will have to install it in the
correct place that the Arduino compiler requires.

I have zipped these libraries from their original sources at Adafruit
and Arduino for your convenience

* **Adafruit-SSD1351-library-master.zip** the OLED display library.
* **Adafruit-GFX-Library-master.zip**  the graphics library.
* **Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library.zip** the DS18S20 temperature
chip library.
* **OneWire.zip** one wire library required by the *Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library*.

These files have to be unzipped and installed in

*~/Documents/Arduino/libraries*

on a Mac. For Linux or Windows, you will have to install it in the
correct place that the Arduino compiler requires.
