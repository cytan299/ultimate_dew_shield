# Bill of Materials

I present the estimated cost for building *one* Ultimate Dew Shield
here to be $280. This is the lower bound for the cost of one such
device because, in practise, it is not possible to just buy 1 screw :)
or is cost effective to buy just one pcb Plus, I did not include tax
or cost of shipping. I would imagine that if people banded together to
build multiple copies of this device, the cost will get closer to
$280.
