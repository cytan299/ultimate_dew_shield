# Bill of Materials

I present the estimated cost for building *one* Ultimate Dew Shield
here to be about $280. This is the lower bound for the cost of one
such device because, in practise, it is not possible to just buy 1
screw :) or is it cost effective to buy just one pcb, and the required
tools, like a soldering iron, are already on hand. Plus, I did not
include tax or cost of shipping. I would imagine that if people banded
together to build multiple copies of this device, the cost will get
closer to $280.
