# Analysis of the control loop

I measured the step response of the control loop when it and my dew
shield  is installed on my LX200. I used the step response to
simulate the performances of a P and PI control loops. And from these
simulations, I found that a P loop is good enough for keeping the
differential temperature between the outside and inside of the dew
shield to better than 0.5 degC.
